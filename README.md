# Assistant-Job-Finder-Web-Dev-Project

This project was created at WSU using Flask and SQLAlchemy in Python as the backend and HTML/CSS as the frontend.
Developed as a large-scale local webpage to utilize the knowledge gained in CS 322 last year.
Many details of this project are purposefully hidden to avoid chances of Academic Dishonesty by future students in the course.
